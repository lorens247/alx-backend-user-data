# 0x00. Personal data

## Introduction
This project focuses on handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) securely within a software application. It covers examples of PII, implementation of a log filter to obfuscate PII fields, encryption of passwords, and authentication to a database using environment variables.

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Examples of PII include, but are not limited to:
- Full name
- Social Security number (SSN)
- Date of birth
- Address
- Email address
- Phone number
- Passport number
- Driver's license number

## Log Filter Implementation
To implement a log filter that obfuscates PII fields, follow these steps:
1. Identify the PII fields in your application's logs.
2. Implement a log filter that intercepts log messages containing PII.
3. Replace PII fields in the log messages with obfuscated values (e.g., asterisks).

## Password Encryption
To encrypt passwords and check the validity of input passwords, follow these best practices:
1. Use a strong cryptographic algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to hash passwords securely.
2. Salt the passwords before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks.
3. Store hashed passwords securely and compare hashed input passwords with stored hashes for authentication.

## Database Authentication Using Environment Variables
To authenticate to a database using environment variables, follow these steps:
1. Set environment variables containing database credentials (e.g., `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`).
2. Access the environment variables in your application code to establish a connection to the database.
3. Ensure that environment variables are securely managed and never hardcode sensitive information in your codebase.

## Conclusion
Handling PII requires careful consideration and implementation of security measures to protect sensitive data. By following best practices for log filtering, password encryption, and database authentication, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
