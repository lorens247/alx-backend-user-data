# 0x01. Basic Authentication

## Introduction
This project explores the concept of basic authentication, including what authentication means, Base64 encoding, and how to implement basic authentication using the Authorization header.

## Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It ensures that the user or entity is who they claim to be before granting access to resources or services.

## Base64 Encoding
Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that converts binary data into ASCII characters. It is commonly used to encode binary data, such as images or cryptographic keys, into a format that can be safely transmitted over text-based protocols, such as HTTP.

## Encoding a String in Base64
To encode a string in Base64, you can use built-in functions or libraries available in most programming languages. For example, in Python, you can use the `base64` module:

```python
import base64

# Encode a string in Base64
encoded_string =
